<p>END OF COPYRIGHT NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, and LICENSE.</p>
<p>TRADEMARK:</p>
<p>The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.</p>
<p>OSI CERTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.</p>
<p>EXPORT CONTROL:</p>
<p>The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
734.7(b).</p>

which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p>
<p>This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
(Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)</li>
<li>You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)</li>
<li>You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
FreeType code. ('credits')</li>

<p>We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
